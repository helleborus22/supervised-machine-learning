# Supervised Machine Learning Homework - Predicting Credit Risk

In this assignment, I built a machine learning model that attempts to predict whether a loan will be approved or not. 

## Background

Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. This data will be used to 

I used this data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, I compared the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.

## Instructions

### Retrieve the data

The data is located in the Resources folder.

* `lending_data.csv`

Import the data using Pandas.

## Consider the models

I created and compared two models on this data: a logistic regression, and a random forests classifier. Before I created, fit, and scored the models, I made a prediction as to which model will perform better.

## Fit a LogisticRegression model and RandomForestClassifier model

I created a LogisticRegression model, fit it to the data, and printed the model's score for both a logistic regression and a RandomForestClassifier.
